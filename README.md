## Background:
The UK Food Standards Agency evaluates various establishments across the United Kingdom and gives them a food hygiene rating. You've been contracted by the editors of a food magazine, Eat Safe, Love, to evaluate some of the ratings data to help their journalists and food critics decide where to focus future articles.
## Analysis Section
Question 1: Which establishments have a hygiene score equal to 20?

Question 2: Which establishments in London have a RatingValue greater than or equal to 4?

Question 3: What are the top 5 establishments with a RatingValue of 5, sorted by lowest hygiene score, nearest to the new restaurant added, "Penang Flavours"?

Question 4: How many establishments in each Local Authority area have a hygiene score of 0? Sort the results from highest to lowest, and print out the top ten local authority areas.
